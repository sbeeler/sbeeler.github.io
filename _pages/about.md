I'm a 6th-year graduate student in [Rob Phillips' group](http://www.rpgroup.caltech.edu/) at Caltech. In the lab, I bring biophysical models to bear on questions of gene regulation and the co-evolution of transcription factors and their binding sites. In the classroom, I enjoy the opportunity to expose students to the value of approaching biological inquiry from computational, mathematical, and physical perspectives. Outside of my academic duties, I enjoy meeting other people's cats and trying out new board and card games.
